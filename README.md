# Collatz Conjecture Project

This project explores the famous Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3x+1 problem, which states that for any positive integer:
- If the number is even, divide it by 2.
- If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

The conjecture posits that no matter what positive integer you start with, you will eventually reach the number 1.

## About

This project is created and maintained by Mustafa. It includes implementations of the Collatz sequence in various programming languages and tools.

## Contents

- `collatzSequence.c`: C program to generate Collatz sequence.
- `collatz_data.txt`: Sample data file containing Collatz sequence results.
- `collatzConj.png`: Visualization of the Collatz Conjecture.

## Usage

1. Compile the C program: `gcc collatzSequence.c -o collatzSequence.exe`.
2. Run the program: `./collatzSequence.exe`.
3. View the generated Collatz sequence in `collatz_data.txt`.
4. Analyze the results and visualize using `collatzConj.png`.
